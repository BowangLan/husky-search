I often found myself frustrated by the tedious process of planning courses in MyPlan. Sometimes, I simply wanted to quickly search for a course or explore a major, but getting to that information required at least 10 clicks â€“ logging in, navigating to the search page, selecting campus, and more.

Experiencing this consistent inefficiency led me to build this website. My goal was to create a tool that makes searching for UW courses and majors significantly easier and more direct, eliminating the unnecessary steps I encountered myself. This project is my effort to streamline that experience for all UW students.

I'm graduating this year (2025), so this project is also a gift from me to future huskies and the UW community as a whole. I'm planning to keep this project alive and updated for years to come. 

Main data sources for this project:

- [UW Course Catalog](https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/)
- [MyPlan](https://myplan.uw.edu/)
- [DawgPath](https://dawgpath.uw.edu/)
- [UW Course Evaluation Catalog](https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/)


My vision for this tool is to offer a way to search courses that is truly *intuitive*, *human-centered*, and *blazingly-fast*. I want this to be the go-to place for UW students to quickly and effectively discover the courses and academic paths that best fit their goals, without any unnecessary friction.
